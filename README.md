# EventSource::Client

A Perl 6 client for [Server-Sent Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/)

## Synopsis

```perl6
use EventSource::Client;

react {
    whenever EventSource::Client.new(source => "http://127.0.0.1:7798/") -> $event {
        say "> " ~ $event.data;
    }
}
```

## Description

[Server-Sent Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) provide a mechanism for
timely delivery of server to client events over HTTP and can in some use-cases
be more convenient than a similar pattern implemented using Web Sockets and is
easier on the network than, for instance, HTTP polling by the client.

This library allows you to consume server sent events in a Perl 6 program in
a reasonably idiomatic and reactive fashion.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Rakudo Perl 6 installation then you should be able to
install this with `zef` :

    zef install EventSource::Client

    # Or from a local clone

    zef install .
